## :tada: Welcome!

Thank you for looking into how to contribute to this project. Bugs, feature requests and fixes are all dealt with using [GitHub issues](https://github.com/jemrobinson/octopusapi/issues). Don't worry if you feel that you don't understand something fully - create an issue or pull request anyway. We appreciate any sort of contribution and the worst that can happen is that you might be asked to change something.

Before contributing, we encourage you to read our CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), our [LICENSE](LICENSE), and our [README](README.md).

Note that all contributions to the project will be released under the existing licence.
